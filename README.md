### Impressions
Jeff
- It was interesting to work on this project fully remote. Although it was hard at first to plan and start the work, we soon got used to it 
and utilized online communications effectively to make it work. I realized how important to set up the API documents as thoroughly as possible 
for the development cycle to be smooth, including the functionality of the API, input types, and output types. If the API documents are 
well-written, we barely even need human to human communications. 

Aparimeya 
- It was quite rough for me personally due to COVID as I have been quite personally affected. Despite all that
I'm glad to have teammates who were understanding and thankfully we were able to clutch this one out. Honestly 
maybe more time for planning could have been used but other than that I believe everyone did their best and 
helped each other.
