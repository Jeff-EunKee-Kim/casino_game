# Presentation 3 outline

1.  Everybody demo
    - Show data files (the content)
    - Show test cases
    - What did we learn?

2. Answering Questions
    - describe how much of the planned features were completed this Sprint and what helped or impeded progress
        - Having clear responsibilities helped us work individually, but we were not able to allocate any time for actual integration. Not having clear times allocated for integration impeded our progress to finish proper integration. 
    - describe a specific significant event that occurred this Sprint and what was learned from it
        - We made some changes into our design, which was not communicated well among everyone of our members. We thought it's important to 
          to mention every changes that go on to the entire team rather than communicating individually 
    - describe what worked, what did not, and something specific that is planned for improvement next Sprint
        - Trying to integrate each of our parts without meeting was a bit hard. 
        - We communicated often through chatting where we decided to change the design, which worked well for those specific classes. However, it wasnâ€™t the best because not everybody were up to date with the change in design.
        - To make it better, whenever there are any changes in the plan, even though it happens between two members, keep it posted in the group chat. Also, we are planning to meet together solely for integration of our parts to make sure everything is working well. 
    - what features are planned to be completed during the next Sprint (taking into account what was done this Sprint), who will work on each feature, and any concerns that may complicate the plan
        - We are planned to have a fully functioning casino game for Roulette, Blackjack, and Slot machine. 
        - Most of our features are implemented at the moment, and we think that most of it is integrating the parts together. Concern would be finding a time that works for everyone so that we can make sure it works. 
          ration and implement an AI that can play play itself with betting.
