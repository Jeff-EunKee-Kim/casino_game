# Presentation2 outline

1.  Everybody demo
    - Show data files (the content)
    - Show test cases
    - What did we learn?

2. Our plan and actual for our sprint
    - What we learned
        - We learned that it is harder to work remotely than we thought
        - It's important to be transparent among the team about each of our progress
    - What could have been better
        - Set up a meeting time during the sprint, not just once at the end to talk about our progress. 
        It will help us know where each of us are at the current sprint and suggest help if needed. 
        - We have to make sure no one is left behind and be supportive of each other.
    - Who will work on which feature for the next sprint
        - TJ: Full UI for the roulette and animations of the game
        - Vincent, Celine: Integration of the backend and frontend
        - Jeff: Work on saving and loading player/bet status. Help with integration and implement an AI that can play play itself with betting.
